/*
 * Boilerplate code means the repetitive, standard, or template-like code you

 * much. example- WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
 * driver.manage().window().maximize();
 * driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(10)); Every

/*
 * SMTP = Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.
 * 
 * It‚Äôs the standard internet protocol used to send emails.
 * 
 * Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook ‚Äî all use SMTP to deliver outgoing mails.
 * 
 * If IMAP/POP3 are like ‚Äúreading emails‚Äù, then SMTP is like ‚Äúsending emails.‚Äù
 * 
 * Properties props = new Properties();
 * 
 * Creates a Properties object (a map-like structure for key-value pairs, often
 * used in Java configuration).
 * Properties extends Hashtable<Object,Object>
 * .put(key, value) ‚Üí adds a key-value pair into the Properties object.
 * 
 * props.put("mail.smtp.host", "smtp.gmail.com");
 * 
 * Sets the mail server host.
 * 
 * Gmail‚Äôs SMTP server is smtp.gmail.com.
 * 
 * This tells JavaMail ‚Äúsend my email via Gmail.‚Äù
 * 
 * props.put("mail.smtp.port", "587");
 * 
 * Sets the port number to connect to Gmail‚Äôs SMTP.
 * 
 * Why 587?
 * 
 * SMTP uses different ports depending on security:
 * 
 * 25 ‚Üí Default SMTP (often blocked by ISPs because spammers misuse it).
 * 
 * 465 ‚Üí SMTP over SSL (legacy).
 * 
 * 587 ‚Üí SMTP with STARTTLS (modern + secure, recommended).
 * 
 * Gmail requires 587 for TLS (Transport Layer Security).
 * 
 * 
 * props.put("mail.smtp.auth", "true");
 * 
 * Tells JavaMail that authentication (username + password) is required.
 * 
 * Without this, you can‚Äôt log in to Gmail.
 * 
 * props.put("mail.smtp.starttls.enable", "true");
 * 
 * Enables STARTTLS ‚Üí a way to upgrade a plain text connection to an encrypted
 * (secure) one.
 * 
 * Gmail requires this for security.
 */



/*
 * 1. What is a port?
 * 
 * Every computer/server has one IP address (like a house address).
 * 
 * But inside that house, many different services can run:
 * 
 * Web server (HTTP)
 * 
 * Email server (SMTP, IMAP, POP3)
 * 
 * Database server (MySQL, etc.)
 * 
 * Each service needs its own door so the OS knows where to deliver incoming
 * traffic.
 * 
 * That door number is called a port.
 * 
 * üëâ Example:
 * 
 * House = smtp.gmail.com
 * 
 * Door 587 = Gmail‚Äôs SMTP send-mail service
 * 
 * Door 993 = Gmail‚Äôs IMAP read-mail service
 * 
 * Door 443 = Gmail‚Äôs HTTPS web service
 * 
 * If you knock on the wrong door, the server won‚Äôt know what you want.
 * 
 * üîπ 2. Why do we need it in email sending?
 * 
 * When your Java program connects to Gmail:
 * 
 * props.put("mail.smtp.host", "smtp.gmail.com"); props.put("mail.smtp.port",
 * "587");
 * 
 * 
 * Host = which building to go to (Gmail‚Äôs server).
 * 
 * Port = which door to knock on (SMTP with STARTTLS).
 * 
 * Without the port, the program would reach Gmail but Gmail wouldn‚Äôt know
 * whether you want to:
 * 
 * send mail (SMTP)
 * 
 * read mail (IMAP/POP3)
 * 
 * open a website (HTTPS)
 * 
 * So, specifying the port is like saying:
 * 
 * ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to send an email, not to browse Gmail‚Äôs website or fetch my inbox.‚Äù
 */




/*
 * WAY A:- Session session = Session.getInstance(props, new Authenticator() {
 * protected PasswordAuthentication getPasswordAuthentication() { return new
 * PasswordAuthentication(fromEmail, password); } });
 * 
 * It‚Äôs exactly the same as creating a named class (MyAuthenticator), but it
 * saves you from writing extra boilerplate code.

 *WAY B:-
 * class MyAuthenticator extends Authenticator { 
 * private String user; 
 * privateString pass;
 * 
 * public MyAuthenticator(String user, String pass) 
 * { this.user = user;
 * this.pass = pass; 
 * }
 * 
 * @Override protected PasswordAuthentication getPasswordAuthentication() {
 * return new PasswordAuthentication(user, pass); } 
 * } 
 * 
 * And then:
 * 
 * Session session = Session.getInstance(props, new MyAuthenticator(fromEmail, password)); 
 * 
 */




/*
 * PasswordAuthentication is part of the javax.mail package (JavaMail API).
 * 
 * üîπ 2. What does it do?
 * 
 * It holds two things:
 * 
 * The username (usually your email address)
 * 
 * The password (your app password, not the normal Gmail password)
 * 
 * So instead of passing strings around separately, JavaMail wraps them in a
 * single object.
 * 
 * üîπ 3. Example PasswordAuthentication auth = new
 * PasswordAuthentication("your_email@gmail.com", "your_app_password");
 * 
 * 
 * auth.getUserName() ‚Üí returns "your_email@gmail.com"
 * 
 * auth.getPassword() ‚Üí returns "your_app_password"
 * 
 * üîπ 4. Why does JavaMail need it?
 * 
 * When Gmail‚Äôs SMTP server says:
 * 
 * ‚ÄúHey client, authenticate yourself!‚Äù
 * 
 * JavaMail calls your Authenticator.getPasswordAuthentication(), which must
 * return a PasswordAuthentication object. That object is then sent as
 * credentials to log in.
 * 
 * 
 * 5. Analogy

Think of it like your ATM card + PIN:

The card alone (username/email) is not enough.

The PIN alone (password) is not enough.

Together ‚Üí they authenticate you.

PasswordAuthentication bundles both together securely.
 */





/*
 * What is a Session?
 * 
 * In JavaMail, a Session represents a mail session (connection context).
 * 
 * It knows:
 * 
 * Which SMTP server to use (props you configured earlier).
 * 
 * Whether authentication is required.
 * 
 * How to get credentials (username & password).
 * 
 * Think of Session as a setup object that knows all connection details.
 * 
 * üîπ 3. What is Authenticator?
 * 
 * Authenticator is a special JavaMail helper class.
 * 
 * Its job is to provide username & password when the SMTP server (Gmail) asks
 * for authentication.
 * 
 * Normally, if you connect to Gmail SMTP, it says: üëâ ‚ÄúWho are you? Give me
 * your username & password.‚Äù
 * 
 * The Authenticator is where you teach JavaMail how to answer that challenge.
 * 
 * üîπ 4. What is getPasswordAuthentication()?
 * 
 * This method is automatically called by JavaMail whenever the server asks for
 * login.
 * 
 * In this code:
 * 
 * return new PasswordAuthentication(fromEmail, password);
 * 
 * 
 * you are returning your Gmail credentials:
 * 
 * fromEmail ‚Üí your Gmail address.
 * 
 * password ‚Üí your Gmail App Password (not the normal password).
 * 
 * So effectively: üì§ Whenever Gmail SMTP says ‚Äúauthenticate!‚Äù ‚Üí JavaMail calls
 * getPasswordAuthentication(), which supplies the credentials.
 * 
 * üîπ 5. Putting it all together
 * 
 * Session.getInstance(props, authenticator) does:
 * 
 * Loads your mail properties (props) ‚Üí which host, which port, TLS, etc.
 * 
 * Stores the authenticator ‚Üí how to log in.
 * 
 * Creates a Session object that will later be used to build and send your
 * email.
 * 
 * When you do:
 * 
 * Transport.send(message);
 * 
 * 
 * JavaMail:
 * 
 * Uses the Session settings ‚Üí goes to smtp.gmail.com:587.
 * 
 * Starts TLS.
 * 
 * Calls your Authenticator ‚Üí gets username/password.
 * 
 * Logs in.
 * 
 * Sends the email.
 */




/*
 * 1. Why Session.getInstance(...) instead of new Session(...)?
 * 
 * The JavaMail API authors made the Session class constructor protected (not
 * public).
 * 
 * This means you cannot directly create a Session object with new Session(...).
 * 
 * üëâ They want you to use factory methods (getInstance() or
 * getDefaultInstance()) instead.
 * 
 * 
 * Analogy
 * 
 * Imagine you want to open a bank account.
 * 
 * You can‚Äôt just say new BankAccount(...) because you don‚Äôt know the bank‚Äôs
 * internal setup.
 * 
 * Instead, you go to the bank‚Äôs Account Manager (the factory method).
 * 
 * They make sure the account is created with the right defaults, checks, and
 * links.
 * 
 * Same idea here ‚Üí JavaMail forces you to use the factory method.
 */













/*
 * Why not only try-catch OR only LogHelper why both is used
 * 
 * 
 * . Two main types of exceptions in Java ‚úÖ Checked exceptions
 * 
 * These are exceptions that must be either handled with try-catch or declared
 * with throws in the method signature.
 * 
 * Compiler checks at compile time ‚Üí if you don‚Äôt handle them, your code won‚Äôt
 * compile.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * IOException (when reading/writing files)
 * 
 * SQLException (when dealing with databases)
 * 
 * MessagingException (when dealing with emails via JavaMail API)
 * 
 * üëâ These usually represent problems you expect might happen in the
 * environment (e.g., file missing, server not reachable).
 * 
 * ‚ùå Unchecked exceptions
 * 
 * Subclasses of RuntimeException.
 * 
 * Compiler doesn‚Äôt force you to handle them.
 * 
 * Examples:
 * 
 * NullPointerException
 * 
 * ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
 * 
 * IllegalArgumentException
 * 
 * üëâ These usually represent programming errors (like a bug in your code).
 * 
 * üîπ 2. Why is MessagingException checked?
 * 
 * Because when you send email:
 * 
 * The mail server might be down.
 * 
 * The network might be unavailable.
 * 
 * Authentication might fail.
 * 
 * These are environmental issues (not coding bugs). JavaMail designers decided:
 * üëâ ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll make this a checked exception so developers are forced to handle it
 * gracefully.‚Äù
 * 
 * üîπ 3. Example // Checked exception: must handle or declare try {
 * Transport.send(message); } catch (MessagingException e) {
 * LogHelper.error("‚ùå Failed to send email", e); }
 * 
 * 
 * If you don‚Äôt write try-catch (or throws MessagingException in method
 * signature), üëâ your code won‚Äôt compile.
 * 
 * üîπ 4. Analogy
 * 
 * Checked exception: Like a traffic rule ‚Üí police (compiler) forces you to stop
 * and check.
 * 
 * Unchecked exception: Like slipping on a banana peel ‚Üí nobody warned you, you
 * just fell.

/*
 * MimeMessage
 * 
 * Think of this as the email itself.
 * 
 * It represents the entire message you will send:
 * 
 * From address
 * 
 * To address
 * 
 * Subject
 * 
 * Content (body, attachments, etc.)
 * 
 * üëâ Analogy: A sealed envelope with everything inside.
 * 
 * 
 * Flow Summary
 * 
 * MimeMessage = the whole email
 * 
 * MimeBodyPart = one piece (text, attachment, image, etc.)
 * 
 * MimeMultipart = a collection of body parts
 * 
 * You put MimeMultipart into MimeMessage, then send it
 */


/*
 * InternetAddress (javax.mail.internet.InternetAddress)
 * 
 * Represents an email address in a structured way.
 * 
 * It validates the format (e.g., xyz@gmail.com).
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * new InternetAddress("abc@gmail.com");
 * 
 * 
 * creates an InternetAddress object containing abc@gmail.com. 
 * 
 * üëâ Analogy: InternetAddress = name + postal address written clearly.
 *  Without this, your email might go to an invalid location.
 * 
 * InternetAddress.parse(toEmail)
 * 
 * Converts a string like "abc@gmail.com, def@gmail.com"
 * 
 * Into an array of InternetAddress objects.
 * 
 * So you can send to multiple people.
 * 
 * üëâ Example:
 * 
 * msg.setRecipients(Message.RecipientType.TO,
 * InternetAddress.parse("abc@gmail.com,def@gmail.com"));
 * msg.setRecipients(Message.RecipientType.CC,
 * InternetAddress.parse("manager@gmail.com"));

 */


/*
 * setRecipient() vs addRecipient() in JavaMail
 * 
 * Both are used to define who will receive your email (TO, CC, BCC). But they
 * behave a little differently:
 * 
 * ‚úÖ setRecipient(RecipientType type, Address address)
 * 
 * Sets a single recipient.
 * 
 * If you call it multiple times for the same type, the previous recipient gets
 * replaced.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * msg.setRecipient(Message.RecipientType.TO, new
 * InternetAddress("abc@gmail.com")); msg.setRecipient(Message.RecipientType.TO,
 * new InternetAddress("def@gmail.com"));
 * 
 * 
 * üëâ Result: Only def@gmail.com will get the email. (abc@gmail.com replaced)
 * 
 * ‚úÖ addRecipient(RecipientType type, Address address)
 * 
 * Adds another recipient without replacing the previous ones.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * msg.addRecipient(Message.RecipientType.TO, newInternetAddress("abc@gmail.com")); 
 * msg.addRecipient(Message.RecipientType.TO,new InternetAddress("def@gmail.com"));
 * 
 * 
 * üëâ Result: Both abc@gmail.com and def@gmail.com will receive the email.
 */



/*
 * CC (Carbon Copy)
 * 
 * Others who should be informed, but are not the main recipient.
 * 
 * Example: Team members who need visibility but don‚Äôt need to act.
 * 
 * Everyone can see who is CC‚Äôd.
 * 
 * BCC (Blind Carbon Copy)
 * 
 * Used when you want to send the email to someone without other recipients
 * knowing.
 * 
 * Recipients in BCC are hidden from TO and CC.

/*
 * InternetAddress
 * 
 * InternetAddress is a JavaMail class that represents an email address.

 * 
 * an optional personal name/label ("Automation Reports")
 * 
 * üîπ What happens here?
 * 
 * fromEmail ‚Üí "your_email@gmail.com" (the actual sender‚Äôs address).
 * 
 * "Automation Reports" ‚Üí the display name that people see in their inbox.
